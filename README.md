# PASSWORD GENERATOR BY K+
##  About PG
The Password generator by K+ (short name: PG) is created with the target of making the web experience of everyone safe. A long and complex password is very important. If it's for your Google, Amazon, bank account,... There are no exceptions to make. One from our Startpage generated password needs 3 sextillion years to be cracked from a computer. Thats alot right? For example: "qwertz1" needs 1 second to be cracked. A long and complex password is very important. PG also has a extremely simple UI (e.g. for young and old people with just a little knowledge about technology). We will do everything to save some peoples online accounts.

## Troubleshooting
If your PG is in light mode run ```-pg background-problem --save``` to put a .jpg background instead of a .svg background. Many Browsers today use "forced dark mode" and this dark mode puts our website to light mode. We are trying to fix that if possible.
