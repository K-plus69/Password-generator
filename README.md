# PASSWORD GENERATOR BY K+
##  About PG
The Password generator by K+ (short name: PG) is created with the target of making the web experience of everyone safe. A long and complex password is very important. If it's for your Google, Amazon, bank account,... There are no exceptions to make. One from our Startpage generated password needs 3 sextillion years to be cracked from a computer. Thats alot right? For example: "qwertz1" needs 1 second to be cracked. A long and complex password is very important. PG also has a extremely simple UI (e.g. for young and old people with just a little knowledge about technology). We will do everything to save some peoples online accounts.
## Installation
You can install PG as a PWA (Progressive Web-App)! It looks like a native app but it isnt. For Android, IOS, Windows! 
### Windows
We tried it on Chrome, Edge, Brave. Go to PG's homepage and at the adress bar you should see a download button. If not wait a few seconds or reload the page.
### Android
We tried it on Chrome, Brave. Go to PG's homepage and at the bottom you should see an "add to the homescreen" or "install" button. If not, go to the 3 dots at the corner and find "install App".
### IOS
Now this is more complicated... It appears only to work on safari and IOS 15+. Go to the PG homepage in safari and go to the share button at the bottom. Then click "add to the homescreen". After that, find PG on your devices homescreen and open it. If it has a splassh screeen with our logo every time you start the app, it means you sucessfuly installed PG as an PWA. If not check your IOS version or safari version.
## PG commands
Open the console and run ```help``` or ```-pg help``` for every command.

e.g. ```-pg link``` (says the current link you currently are), ...

## Troubleshooting
If your PG is in light mode run ```-pg background-problem --save``` to put a .jpg background instead of a .svg background. Many Browsers today use "forced dark mode" and this dark mode puts our website to light mode. We are trying to fix that if possible.
