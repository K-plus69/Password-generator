 ##  About PG 

 The Password generator by K+ (short name: PG) is created with the target of making the web experience of everyone safe. A long and complex password is very important. If it's for your Google, Amazon, bank account,... There are no exceptions to make. One from our Startpage generated password needs 3 sextillion years to be cracked from a computer. That's a lot, right? For example: "qwertz1" needs 1 second to be cracked. A long and complex password is very important. PG also has an extremely simple UI (e.g. for young and old people with just a little technology knowledge). We will do everything to save some people's online accounts. 

 ## Installation 

 You can install PG as a PWA (Progressive Web-App)! It looks like a native app but it isn't. For Android, IOS, Windows!  

 ### Windows 

 We tried it on Chrome, Edge, Brave. Go to PG's homepage and at the address bar, you should see a download button. If not wait a few seconds or reload the page. 

 ### Android 

 We tried it on Chrome, Brave. Go to PG's homepage and at the bottom, you should see an "add to the home screen" or "install" button. If not, go to the 3 dots at the corner and find "install App". 

 ### IOS 

 Now, this is more complicated... It appears only to work on safari and IOS 15+. Go to the PG homepage in safari and go to the share button at the bottom. Then click "add to the home screen". After that, find PG on your device's home screen and open it. If it has a splash screen with our logo every time you start the app, it means you successfully installed PG as a PWA. If not check your IOS version or safari version. 

 ## PG commands 

 Open the console and run ```help``` or ```-pg help``` for every command. 

  

 e.g. ```-pg link``` (says the current link you currently are), ... 

  

 ## Troubleshooting 

 If your PG is in light mode run ```-pg background-problem --save``` to put a .jpg background instead of a .svg background. Many Browsers today use "forced dark mode" and this dark mode puts our website to light mode. We are trying to fix that if possible.
