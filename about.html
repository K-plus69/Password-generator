     <p>The Password generator by K+ is created with the target of making the internet safe.
    A long and complex password is very important. If it's for your Google account, bank account,... There are no exceptions to make.
    One from our Startpage generated password needs 3 sextillion years to be cracked from a computer. Thats alot right? For example: "qwertz1" needs 1 second to be cracked.
