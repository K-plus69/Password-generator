     <h1>About</h1>
     <p>The Password generator by K+ is created with the target of making the internet safe. Maybe you detected "Google Analytics" Cookies. Yeah that true. We use Google analytics to view our Website traffic but we do NOT collect any generated/downloaded/copied passwords. We only see how many people visit our website and what country you have.
<br>
<br>
A long and complex password is very important. If it's for your Google account, bank account,... There are no exceptions to make.
One from our Startpage generated password needs 3 sextillion  (3000000000000000000000000000000000000) years to be cracked from a computer. It's alot right? For example: "qwertz1" needs 1 second to be cracked.
<br>
<br>
K+ is a small start-up with the target of making the internet safe. We have officially 2 members (me and fynn.) We don't want to earn any money from ads because they are very annoying. If you want, you can donate crypto. That's all. Just sharing our products with your family and friends makes us very happy!</p>
